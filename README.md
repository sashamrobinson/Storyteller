<h4> An iOS app built using Firebase and OpenAI with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities. Designed for telling stories. </h4>

<h4>Summary</h4>
Speak with Storyteller, your virtual friend, and build unique stories from your personalized conversations

Storyteller will have a conversation with you, helping you create a full story about anything in you wish. You can tell Storyteller about anything from cherished moments, like your child's first steps, to everyday anecdotes, like your walk to work.

Once you are finished your conversation, watch as your personalized story is created, filled with every last detail and additional polish to make your story perfect. Now, you get the chance to make any last minute edits, upload a picture to remember the story and decide if you want to publish your story for others to see.

As well as creating stories, you can scroll through other peoples stories to read or listen to, or even seek out a specific genre of stories you are interested in.

No matter what, Storyteller has something for everyone.
