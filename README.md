<h4> A website built using Vue, hosted with Vercel. Designed for allowing users to debate and speak with each other on controversial topics. </h4>

Vent was single-handedly built over a two-month period in the summer of 2023. It was designed with the purpose of creating a platform for users to debate on specific issues, in a regulated, civil way. Users are able to create an account, select a topic of conversation and be matched up with another user of the opposing opinion. Here, they are able to discuss freely and try to help each other see their perspective.

Vent was designed in Figma, built using a Vue/HTML5/CSS3 front-end stack with a Firebase backend, and deployed using Vercel through Github. The project served as a chance for me to increase my fluency with web developement, learn new libraries and frameworks, and to gather experience deploying and continously integrating to a live server.


The project is currently live at: vent-live.vercel.app
